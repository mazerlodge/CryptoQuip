	X- Enter an encoded phrase and have it generate and use the pattern. (0712)
	- Filter results based on a partial phrase, e.g. ?hi???? (chicken)
	- Pass in phrase and have missing words reported/added to dictionary.

> Add to CQ:
	X- Add '?' as input to CQ to show usage
	X- Add 'save' as input to CQ to save phrase AND translation table
	X- Check output plist, writing path not encoded phrase.
	X- Add 'load' as input to CQ to load stored phrase
	X Sort Distribution before outputting (done 20190526)
	- Add confirmation dialog before ‘Set Phrase’ when a phrase is in progress (trans table is not empty).
	- Add show trans table command (trans?) 1230
	- Add $ prefix to trans to do a substitution e.g. $Y=g substitutes whatever Y was before 1230
