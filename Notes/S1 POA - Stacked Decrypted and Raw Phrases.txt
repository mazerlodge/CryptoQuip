S1 POA - Stacked Decrypted and Raw Phrases

Issue - Raw and decrypted phrases are too hard to relate when displayed in separate windows.  

Resolution - This issue has been fixed.

Approach - Stack the phrases in a single text area, decoded text appearing above raw text, using a non-scalable font so characters align.  Create a single text string to be output to the text area.  When merged in a single window, accommodate line wrapping at 36 characters (for Courier 14 font).

Inputs - 2 text phrases (raw and decoded) and one letter substitution clue (e.g. Z=o).

Processing -  
- Retain existing process to generate decoded phrase 
- Add output preparation process to merge raw and decoded with appropriate line wrapping 
	-- 'Appropriate' means after 36 characters unless that would break a word, then use the last whitespace 
	-- Leave a blank line between 'wrapped segments'.

- Detect Breakpoint
	-- Inputs to this process are raw line and a start point
	-- Find char at target breakpoint (pos start point + 36)
	-- If not a space, step back (target--, e.g. 36--) until space is found
	-- note and return target pos

- Generate Output Line 
	-- Inputs to this process are; raw line, decoded line
	-- set substring start point (startPos) to 0
	-- while (raw line length < start point)
		-- Calculate breakpoint position by call to Detect Breakpoint, passing in raw line and current start point
		-- Get current segment by substring of decoded from start point to start point + breakpoint
		-- Add current segment to output string
		-- Pad the output out to 36 characters
		-- Get current segment by substring of raw from start point to start point + breakpoint
		-- Add current segment to output string
		-- Pad the output out to 36 characters
		-- set start point to start point + breakpoint
	-- return output line


Output Example
---------------
P-text: the quick brown fox. 
R-text: ESP BFTNV MCZHY QZI.

Simulated output window with break at 12 characters (would break in the word 'brown', so break placed at last whitespace):
+------------+
|the quick   |
|ESP BFTNV   |
|            |
|brown fox.  |
|MCZHY QZI.  |
